## Self-hosting

Currently shorty is intended to be run behind a reverse proxy to take advantage of multiple URLs and
https. I personally use nginx, but you can use any reverse proxy you want.

There's multiple ways to run shorty, you can either grab a pre-compiled binary (from a release for example)
or you can compile it yourself.

### Self compiling

If you have decided to compile it yourself you need to clone this repository.
You will also need a functioning [rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once both of these requirements are met, you can compile shorty with `cargo build --release`.
After the compilation is done you can find the resulting binary in the `target/release` folder
which should have appeared.

### Configuration

A sample config with the name `config.toml.sample` is provided in this repository. Alternatively, if it
can't find a config file,shorty will create the sample at the config location.
The config location by default is next to the binary, but can be customized via the `SHORTY_CONFIG`
environment variable.

### Reverse Proxy
If you want HTTPS you currently have to run shorty behind a reverse proxy like nginx.
This might change in the future when/if shorty gets the ability to handle HTTPS by itself. If you don't 
want or need HTTPS then you can also just run shorty on its own.
Another reason for a reverse proxy would be hosting shorty alongside other things that require the HTTP(S) 
port, like a website or another HTTP service.

I personally use nginx but any other reverse proxy should work as well.
There is a sample nginx config included in the repository [here](meta/shorty.conf).
